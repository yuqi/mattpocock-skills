# Out-of-Scope Knowledge Base

The `.out-of-scope/` directory in a repo stores persistent records of rejected feature requests. It serves two purposes:

1. **Institutional memory**: why a feature was rejected, so the reasoning isn't lost when the local ticket becomes `wontfix`
2. **Deduplication**: when a new ticket matches a prior rejection, the skill can surface the previous decision instead of re-litigating it

## Directory structure

```
.out-of-scope/
├── dark-mode.md
├── plugin-system.md
└── graphql-api.md
```

One file per **concept**, not per ticket. Multiple tickets requesting the same thing are grouped under one file.

## File format

The file should be written in a relaxed, readable style, more like a short design document than a database entry. Use paragraphs, code samples, and examples to make the reasoning clear and useful to someone encountering it for the first time.

```markdown
# Dark Mode

This project does not support dark mode or user-facing theming.

## Why this is out of scope

The rendering pipeline assumes a single color palette defined in
`ThemeConfig`. Supporting multiple themes would require:

- A theme context provider wrapping the entire component tree
- Per-component theme-aware style resolution
- A persistence layer for user theme preferences

This is a significant architectural change that doesn't align with the
project's focus on content authoring. Theming is a concern for downstream
consumers who embed or redistribute the output.

```ts
// The current ThemeConfig interface is not designed for runtime switching:
interface ThemeConfig {
  colors: ColorPalette; // single palette, resolved at build time
  fonts: FontStack;
}
```

## Prior requests

- `.scratch/theme/issues/42-dark-mode.md`: "Add dark mode support"
- `.scratch/theme/issues/87-night-theme.md`: "Night theme for accessibility"
- `.scratch/theme/issues/134-dark-theme.md`: "Dark theme option"
```

### Naming the file

Use a short, descriptive kebab-case name for the concept: `dark-mode.md`, `plugin-system.md`, `graphql-api.md`. The name should be recognizable enough that someone browsing the directory understands what was rejected without opening the file.

### Writing the reason

The reason should be substantive: not "we don't want this" but why. Good reasons reference:

- Project scope or philosophy ("This project focuses on X; theming is a downstream concern")
- Technical constraints ("Supporting this would require Y, which conflicts with our Z architecture")
- Strategic decisions ("We chose to use A instead of B because...")

The reason should be durable. Avoid referencing temporary circumstances ("we're too busy right now"); those aren't real rejections, they're deferrals.

## When to check `.out-of-scope/`

During triage (Step 1: Gather context), read all files in `.out-of-scope/`. When evaluating a new ticket:

- Check if the request matches an existing out-of-scope concept
- Matching is by concept similarity, not keyword: "night theme" matches `dark-mode.md`
- If there's a match, surface it to the maintainer: "This is similar to `.out-of-scope/dark-mode.md`. We rejected this before because [reason]. Do you still feel the same way?"

The maintainer may:

- **Confirm**: the new ticket gets added to the existing file's "Prior requests" list, then receives `Status: wontfix`
- **Reconsider**: the out-of-scope file gets deleted or updated, and the ticket proceeds through normal triage
- **Disagree**: the tickets are related but distinct, proceed with normal triage

## When to write to `.out-of-scope/`

Only when an **enhancement** (not a bug) is rejected as `wontfix`.

Do **not** write here when something receives `Status: wontfix` because it is **already implemented**. That is a built feature, not a rejected one; recording it would poison the dedup checks with false rejections. Instead, the ticket's Comments section points to where the feature already lives.

The flow:

1. Maintainer decides a feature request is out of scope
2. Check if a matching `.out-of-scope/` file already exists
3. If yes: append the new ticket to the "Prior requests" list
4. If no: create a new file with the concept name, decision, reason, and first prior request
5. Append the decision and `.out-of-scope/` reference under the ticket's `## Comments`
6. Set the ticket's `Status:` to the mapped `wontfix` value

## Updating or removing out-of-scope files

If the maintainer changes their mind about a previously rejected concept:

- Delete the `.out-of-scope/` file
- The skill does not need to change old tickets; they are historical records
- The new ticket that triggered the reconsideration proceeds through normal triage
