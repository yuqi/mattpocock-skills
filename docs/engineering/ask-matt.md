## What it does

`ask-matt` is the router over the skills in this repo. You describe the situation you are in (an idea you cannot start, a pile of incoming bug reports, a [session](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/session) that has run long), and it names the skill or the sequence of skills that fits, plus where the human decisions in that sequence sit.

It recommends and stops. It does not grill, write a [spec](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/spec), open a file or fire the skill it just named; what you get back is the next thing to type, and you type it. It is also a hand-written map of the skills in this repo rather than a scan of what you have installed, so it will not route you over your own skills or another author's.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/ask-matt`; the agent won't reach for it on its own.

| Your situation | What the router gives back |
| --- | --- |
| An idea, and no idea where to start | The head of the main flow, and whether the build is small enough to skip the spec |
| Bugs and requests arriving from other people | The [triage](https://aihero.dev/skills-triage) on-ramp, and why [tickets](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/ticket) you generated yourself don't belong on it |
| Two skills that look interchangeable | The line between them, and it is usually one concrete test rather than a matter of taste. [grill-me](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-me) or [grill-with-docs](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-with-docs) turns on whether you are in a working directory; [grill-with-docs](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-with-docs) or [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder) turns on whether the effort fits one session |
| A long session and a decision about the [context](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/context) | The ordered tree over the five options at a phase boundary |
| An implemented change and uncertainty about review scope | [ticket-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-ticket-review) for one ticket, [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) for a broader branch, or [spec-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-spec-review) for the completed umbrella |
| An accepted legacy spec whose criteria lack stable IDs or ticket mappings | The beta `migrate-spec-acceptance` repair step, but only when the spec already has a standalone authoritative acceptance set |
| A skill you have already picked | Nothing useful. Invoke that skill directly. |

## Prerequisites

The router names skills; it does not install them. Everything it points at has to be installed for the recommendation to be actionable. Most routes use promoted skills; the legacy acceptance repair route points at an in-progress beta skill that must be installed separately.

The tracker-dependent routes (triage, `to-spec`, `to-tickets`, `ticket-implement`, `ticket-review`, `spec-review`) assume [setup-matt-pocock-skills](https://aihero.dev/skills-setup-matt-pocock-skills) has already configured the local markdown Issue Tracker. The router will happily recommend them before that has happened.

## Flows, not skills

The word the skill gives you to think with is **flow**: a path *through* the skills, not a single one. Naming your situation places you on a flow at a step, which is a different answer from "here is the skill that matches your keywords". Four kinds of route exist, and the skill itself carries them in full:

- **The main flow**, idea to ship. Grill, spec, tickets, then give [ticket-implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-ticket-implement) one ticket or the local ticket directory. It works a multi-ticket dependency frontier sequentially with one fresh context per ticket, persists ticket acceptance, then leaves cumulative spec acceptance and any existing spec-checklist projection to the final gate. A legacy spec that already has an authoritative acceptance section can take the beta `migrate-spec-acceptance` repair step before that final gate; User Stories are never substituted for the missing section. Small work stays on [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement), whose upstream review-before-commit flow remains unchanged.
- **On-ramps**, for a situation that generates work and then merges onto the main flow: incoming bug reports, something broken, or an effort too foggy and too large to hold in one session. A local ticket that `triage` marks agent-ready enters through `ticket-implement`, so it receives the same persisted ticket acceptance as tickets from `to-tickets`.
- **Standalones**, off every flow, reached for on their own terms: the prototype, the questionnaire, the merge conflict you are already sitting in.
- **A vocabulary layer underneath**, the two references the other skills pull in when the words rather than the process are the problem.

## The phase boundary

The other idea it hands you is the **phase boundary**. A phase is a chunk of work inside a session (the [grilling](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/grilling), the implementation, the QA), and the boundary between two of them is the only place the question "what do I do with this context?" belongs. Mid-phase there is nothing to decide: continue, or split what is left into [subagents](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/subagent).

| Option | Take it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Continue** | The next phase wants this one verbatim, or you have [smart zone](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/smart-zone) left. It is the only move that keeps the session as a [primary source](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/primary-source), so rule it out first |
| **`/clear`** | Everything behind you is disposable. Cheapest move on the board, and one-way if you were wrong |
| **[handoff](https://aihero.dev/skills-handoff)** | Something has to travel: a new [harness](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/harness), a new directory, a colleague, a side task forked mid-phase |
| **Subagent** | The task is scoped tightly enough to run with you [away from the keyboard](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/afk) |
| **`/compact`** | None of the above. The default, and it lands here often |

Two of those are routinely got wrong, which is why the router carries the order rather than the list. `/handoff` reads like the general bridge between windows and is not: portability is the whole of what it buys. `/compact` is the bottom of the tree rather than the first reach, because the four questions above it are each cheaper or more precise.

## Common questions

**Isn't there just a list of the skills in the right order?**

People keep asking for one in the README. This skill is that list: it is what it exists for. A static table would say `wayfinder → to-spec → to-tickets → ticket-implement → ticket-review → spec-review` and be wrong for most situations, because the interesting parts are the branches: is there a codebase, does the build span sessions, can this question be settled by talking, and is the review boundary one ticket or the whole umbrella. The honest cost is that the router is hand-maintained and lags the repo.

**It told me half the skills aren't installed.**

A known bug, unfixed. Most of the skills the router routes you through set `disable-model-invocation: true`, which means the harness leaves them out of the skill list it injects into the agent's context. The agent reads that list as exhaustive and reports them missing. One reported session had it declare the whole spec-and-tickets flow absent and reroute to bare `/grilling` and `/tdd`. Thirteen of the plugin's twenty-two skills carry the flag, so this is the common case rather than an edge. They are installed. Type the slash command anyway, or check `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, which is the authority on what is present.

**It described a skill's behaviour, and the skill doesn't do that.**

Also real, also unfixed. The router answers from its own one-line summary of each skill rather than from the skill. One detailed report tracked three instances in a single session, including a recommendation to skip [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec) on the strength of the gloss "turn the thread into a spec": `to-spec/SKILL.md` was never opened. In every case it verified only after the user pushed back, and never on its own initiative. Skipping `to-spec` there cost a real seam check, and the tickets that came out undercounted the work. When the router asserts something load-bearing about another skill, ask it to open that `SKILL.md` first. The same applies to questions the map does not cover at all, such as whether to use [plan mode](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/agent-mode): that answer is the [model](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/model)'s inference, not something written down here.

**Why is it prose instead of a numbered checklist?**

A fair complaint, filed as an open issue arguing that most of the routing is deterministic and the narrative makes it hard to scan. Nothing stops you asking for the compressed form: "just give me the sequence" gets you the sequence. What the prose is carrying is the conditional half: the branches, where a human decision is expected, and where to clear or compact between steps. A flat checklist drops exactly that.

**Can it route over my own skills, or another author's?**

No. Three separate proposals have asked for a router that reads your local `skills/` directory and recommends from whatever is installed. `ask-matt` is not that. It is a map of one set, maintained by hand, and it knows nothing about skills you wrote or installed from elsewhere.

**It told me to edit a SKILL.md.**

That advice is often correct and rarely durable. Ticket acceptance no longer requires editing [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement): use [ticket-implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-ticket-implement) for local tickets and queues. It preserves the upstream `implement` flow while adding fixed ticket boundaries and persisted review results in its own skill.

**It named a skill I don't have, or missed one I do.**

Check the changelog for a rename before assuming it is gone. `writing-great-skills` became [writing-for-agents](https://aihero.dev/skills-writing-for-agents) with no alias, `to-prd` became [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec), and `pathfinder` became [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder). Four skills were retired outright into the skills that absorbed them: `ubiquitous-language`, `design-an-interface`, `qa` and `request-refactor-plan`. The reverse case is the router's own lag, above.

## It's working if

- It ends by naming what to type and stops there, instead of starting the work itself.
- The route it gives back names the context boundary and review boundary, not just a list of skill names.
- Where two skills are close, it says which one and why the other is wrong for you.
- For a legacy spec, it distinguishes traceability repair from authoring acceptance criteria and refuses to treat User Stories as the latter.
- Any claim it makes about another skill's behaviour shows up in the trace as it reading that skill's `SKILL.md`.
- You recognise your own situation in what it hands back, rather than the nearest generic scenario.

## Where it fits

`ask-matt` is a **standalone router** that sits over the whole set. It is never a step in a chain; it points into every chain, and it is the node the other docs pages link back to so none of them has to redraw the graph. From here you most often land on [grill-with-docs](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-with-docs), the head of the main flow, or [triage](https://aihero.dev/skills-triage), the on-ramp for work that arrived rather than work you started.

It is a [secondary source](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/secondary-source) over the skills it describes. Where the router and a `SKILL.md` disagree, the `SKILL.md` is right.
